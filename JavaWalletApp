Introduction to the Java Wallet App Project
A Java Wallet App is a digital solution that enables users to store, manage, and transact with virtual currency or payment methods. This application can range from a simple wallet for personal budgeting to a complex digital wallet supporting multi-currency transactions, secure payments, and integration with banking systems.

Purpose of the Project
The main goal of the Java Wallet App is to:

Provide Convenience: Offer users a seamless way to manage funds and transactions digitally.
Enhance Security: Ensure secure storage and transfer of funds with encryption and authentication mechanisms.
Enable Accessibility: Allow users to access their wallet from various devices with real-time updates.
Promote Financial Management: Include features like transaction history, budgeting tools, and reminders.

Key Features of the Java Wallet App
User Authentication:

Secure login system using credentials or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Example: Username/Password and OTP verification.
Digital Wallet:

Virtual storage for managing balances.
Support for adding funds, transferring money, and withdrawing.
Transaction Management:

Track and display transaction history with timestamps and details.
Generate summaries or reports.
Integration with Payment Gateways:

Support for making payments through APIs (e.g., Razorpay, PayPal, Stripe).
Security Features:

Encryption for sensitive data.
Token-based transactions to prevent fraud.

Real-Time Notifications:

Notify users about successful payments, balance updates, or failed transactions.
Budgeting Tools:

Set spending limits and track expenses.
Cross-Platform Access:

Compatible with web, mobile, or desktop applications using frameworks like JavaFX or Spring Boot.

Technology Stack
Backend:

Java: Core logic and functionality of the wallet.
Spring Boot: RESTful APIs for integration and scalability.
Frontend:

JavaFX for a desktop GUI or JSP/HTML for web interface.
Database:

MySQL/PostgreSQL: For storing user data, transactions, and balances.
APIs:

Integration with payment gateways or third-party services.
Security:

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure session handling.
Bcrypt for password hashing.
Real-Time Features:

WebSockets for instant notifications.
Push Notifications for mobile platforms.

Modules in the Java Wallet App
User Module:

Register, login, and manage profile settings.
Wallet Module:

Add money to the wallet using credit/debit cards or bank accounts.
View current balance.
Transaction Module:

Transfer funds to other users or merchants.
Display transaction history with filters (date, type, etc.).
Reports and Analytics:

Visual representation of spending trends.
Monthly or yearly reports.
Security Module:

Encryption and token-based authorization.

Project Workflow
User Registration:

A user creates an account and sets up authentication.
Add Funds:

Link a bank account or card to load money into the wallet.
Make Payments:

Transfer funds to other users or pay for goods and services.
View History:

Access a detailed log of all transactions, categorized for easy analysis.
Notifications:

Receive alerts for every transaction or balance update.
Manage Settings:

Change profile details, reset password, or update linked payment methods.

Benefits of the Java Wallet App
User-Friendly:

Intuitive interface for non-technical users.
Enhanced Security:

Protects sensitive financial data.
Time-Saving:

Eliminates the need for physical cash handling.
Customizable:

Modular design allows easy addition of new features.

Potential Extensions
Multi-Currency Support:

Handle different currencies and exchange rates.
Crypto Wallet Integration:

Enable storage and transactions for cryptocurrencies.
Loan and EMI Management:

Support for micro-loans and payment schedules.
AI-Powered Insights:

Analyze spending habits and suggest optimizations.
